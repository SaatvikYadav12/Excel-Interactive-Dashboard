# Excel-Interactive-Dashboard

This is the project for excel basics involving data cleaning, data processing and data analysis, taking help from the YouTube video by Rishabh Mishra.

Step 1: Data Cleaning
First the data is cleaned and ensured that it is in a consistant format using "find and replace" function in excel. The data changes are in the "Gender" field as well as the "Qty" field.

Stap 2: Data processing
The data is grouped according to usability as well as ease of access for interpretation. 

Step 3: Data visualization
The data is first converted into pivot table and then later converted into a pivot chart which is displayed on the dashboard of the excel sheet and at the same time we also add slicers in the dashboard so that we can control the flow of the data
